### About

<div align="center">

</div>

OTTY is not just another blazing-fast terminal emulator. It starts from a different premise: the terminal should be the primary workspace for development and operations, not just a shell inside a fragmented toolchain.

Developers already spend much of their time in the terminal, yet modern terminals remain narrow interfaces. As a result, engineers constantly switch between the terminal, editors, dashboards, and SSH clients instead of working in one coherent environment. OTTY is built to turn the terminal into that environment.

### Key feautres

- **Explorer that stays in sync with your work**  
  Browse project files from the sidebar and keep navigation aligned with the directory of the active terminal session.

- **Quick Launch for saved commands and SSH targets**  
  Save frequently used commands or SSH connections and launch them without retyping the same input every time.


- **Block-based terminal UI**  
  OTTY structures terminal output activity around atomic command blocks, making it easier to control each command and its output.
